* **Search** - search for other images in the Cloud
* **Launch** - launch an image (starts a server machine)
* **Remove** - delete an image from the cloud
* **Deprecate** - deprecate an image to prevent it from being launched and used in a new deployment
* **Register DCM Agent** - tells DCM that a machine image has the agent pre-installed (note that it doesn't automatically install the agent)
