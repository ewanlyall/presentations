# Setting a role for a group
<p></p>
On the **Role Assignments** tab use the dropdowns to select the required role for each cloud account

In this example, all members of this group will be granted the Admin role for the Openstack account, the Basic User role for the AWS account and no role (and therefore no permission) for the AWS-2 account
