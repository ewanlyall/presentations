Dell Cloud Manager creates jobs for many of the actions issued from the console, especially those that request services from the cloud:

* **Launching and terminating servers** 
* **Making images**
* **Creating and modifying firewalls**
* **Creating volumes**
* **Attaching volumes**
* **Creating snapshots**
* etc. etc.

You can display the status of the jobs from the Dell Cloud Manager console **Job History** page.

* **Description** - the action requested from the console.
* **Start** - the job start time
* **End** - the job end time
* **Message** - contains a status message for the job. It will contain an error message if the job failed. For some actions it will contain a "resource" identifier (eg the Server ID).

Failed jobs are highlighted in red and marked **Attention required...*
