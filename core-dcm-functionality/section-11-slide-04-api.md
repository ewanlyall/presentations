# API
<p></p>
The Dell Cloud Manager REST API supports standard HTTP requests against resources, generally:

* **GET** - queries for a list of resources, or the details of a specific resource
* **POST** - creates a new resource
* **PUT** - updates an existing resource
* **DELETE** - terminates a resource
* **HEAD** - returns response headers, including a count of matching resources

Responses can either be in JSON or XML format.

The client signs each request using the **Access Key** and provides the signature as part of the request header.
