# API
<p></p>
The Dell Cloud Manager REST API gives end users programatic access to all the features that are avalable through the user interface.

* Access to create API keys is governed by RBAC
* Similarly, API keys have the same set of permissions as the user would have if they were logged into the console
* API keys can be set to expire after a period of time, and will automatically expire if the user's account is disabled.

There are two different types of API key, **User Keys** and **Account Keys**

* **User Keys** - have access to the same cloud accounts and resources as the user
* **Account Keys** - are limited to use within a single cloud account
