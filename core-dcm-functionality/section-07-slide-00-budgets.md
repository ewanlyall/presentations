* Dell Cloud Manager provides the ability to track and control your costs incurred in the cloud.

* Dell Cloud Manager tracks infrastructure costs based on the costs reported by the cloud provider or in the case of an on-premise installation of Dell Cloud Manager, against a customizable set of values.

* Dell Cloud Manager calculates costs based on the hourly run rate for usage. 

* Servers, storage, load balancers, and IP Addresses are all examples of items that have an associated cost in many of the public clouds. 

* Budgets can be setup quickly and easily from Dell Cloud Manager by creating **Budget Codes** containing soft and hard quotas. 

* The Budgets Codes are then used to track and control your expenses in the cloud.

  * Soft quotas generate notification warnings.
  * Hard quotas prevent further activity.
