# Load Balancers
<p></p>

#### **The Dell Cloud Manager console Load Balancer page displays the cloud provider's platform-as-a-service Load Balancers**
<p></p>
(e.g. Amazon Web Services Elastic Load Balancer)

<p></p>

* All Load Balancers across all Cloud Accounts and Regions (that the user has access to) are aggregated into a single list.
* The list of Load Balancers is sortable and filterable.

<p></p>

#### **These tasks can be performed providing the user has the necessary access rights:**

<p></p>

* **Add Load Balancer** - create a new Load Balancer.
* **Manage Servers** - add and remove servers to the list of servers being served by the Load Balancer.
* **Manage Zones** - add and remove zones to the Load Balancer.
* **View Listeners** - display the Load Balancer listeners.
* **Remove** - delete the Load Balancer.
