# Creating Access Rights
<p></p>

#### **Qualifier**

<p></p>

There are three Qualifiers available when creating an access right: **ANY**, **GROUP**, and **MINE**.  

Only one Qualifier per access right can be selected.

<p></p>

<p></p>

To explain how the Qualifier works assume we are creating an Access Right to allow users to make an image of a server.

* The Resource in the Access Right is **Server**.
* The Policy in the Access Right is **Image** (make an image of a server).

<p></p>

<p></p>

Now applying the 3 different Qualifiers to the Access Right:

* **ANY** - users with this access right can make an image of any server.

* **GROUP** - users with this access right can make an image of any server owned by a group that they are a member of.

* **MINE** - users with this access right can make an image of any server that they own (servers they have launched).
